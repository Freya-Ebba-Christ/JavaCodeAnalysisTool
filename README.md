<br>
This is just another step on my journey to creating a Java Code Analysis, Debugging, and Refactoring tool.
<br>
The fight with the dragon has just begun... (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools)
<br>
Note: I will eventually merge all currently existing repositories involving code analysis, debugging, and refactoring into one comprehensive suite.
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> It will take a while until the code is usable! E.g. the automatic refactoring using the captured logic of null checks is still missing!
